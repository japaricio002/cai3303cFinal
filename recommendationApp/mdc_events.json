The invited experts will cover topics like how to put together a successful portfolio, how to connect with local art institutions, how do artist build their networks, and what opportunities for graduate education exist in Miami.  This series of lecture-conversations are organized in the spirit of helping students to build their tribe and their art communities.\nIn this lecture, Dr. Laura Hutchison-Bhatti will highlight two of The Metal Museum's current exhibitions - Health in Enamel and Branching Out - and will talk about museum community programming and how it benefits the community at large. The Metal Museum is the only institution of its kind in North America, and one of only a few in the world devoted exclusively to metalwork. The Metal Museum leads the way in the celebration, recognition, and promotion in the field of fine metalwork. \n \nDr. Laura Hutchison Bhatti is the Director of Collections & Exhibitions at the Metal Museum. Dr. Bhatti received her PhD in Classics and Classical Archaeology from Johns Hopkins University. With an academic background in ancient Mediterranean craft and iconography, Dr. Bhatti has more recently turned her curatorial eye to modern American craft, and specifically metal work. At the Metal Museum, Dr. Bhatti enjoys encouraging questions around making and displaying, relishes in witnessing engagement with three-dimensional objects in the galleries and finds the opportunity to collaborate with living artists a refreshing shift from her background in the ancient past. A native Memphian herself, Dr. Bhatti appreciates her role in continuing to share the history of her city through the curation of pressing and timely exhibitions.\n \nThe Metal Museum achieves its mission through four interrelated programming areas - rotating exhibitions of historic and contemporary metalwork; the Permanent Collection of objects, books, folios, and archives; the Metals Studios comprised of a Blacksmith Shop, Foundry, small metals lab, and design lab that provide educational opportunities for metalsmiths through artistic creation; and vibrant community education and engagement programming for learners of all ages. This broad, yet dedicated, focus attracts visitors, artists, and patrons from all 50 states and from across the globe to the Museum each year. Thousands more are served during off-site programming and community events across Shelby County through the Mini Mobile Metal Museum.\nThe Metal Museum has established itself as the center for metal arts – a place that promotes artists and their work through award-winning exhibitions and a dynamic permanent collection, contributes to teaching the next generation of artists through its Metals Studios, and advances the education of the public through innovative community engagement activities.",

Featuring works from as early as 1977 to present day, this exhibition celebrates the artist’s practice as a printmaker and honors her legacy as an active member of the South Florida art community.\nWhile based in Miami, Florida, Bowens-Saffo was engaged with the Miami Black Arts Workshop (MBAW) and an influential educator at the Barnyard Community Center in the historical Coconut Grove neighborhood. Impactful experiences in Richmond Heights and Coconut Grove nurtured her consciousness and propelled her decades-long commitment to art for and about people. Specializing in printmaking and mixed media constructions, Bowens-Saffo's art delves into social and political human relations, emphasizing the African American experience.\nBorn in Richmond Heights, Florida and currently living and working in Tallahassee, Bowens-Saffo received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Howard University and her MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. She is the recipient of awards from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nFrom the Heights contemplates the role played by art collectives, explores the importance of archiving an artist’s oeuvre, and enlightens issues of race, gender, and class as it relates to history writing.\nThis exhibition was developed in collaboration with the Women Artists Archive Miami (WAAM).\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor, and Board of County Commissioners.

    "Event Summary": "From the Heights marks South Florida native Kabuya Pamela Bowens-Saffo’s first solo art exhibition in Miami. Featuring works from as early as 1977 to present day, this exhibition celebrates the artist’s practice as a printmaker and honors her legacy as an active member of the South Florida art community.\nWhile based in Miami, Florida, Bowens-Saffo was engaged with the Miami Black Arts Workshop (MBAW) and an influential educator at the Barnyard Community Center in the historical Coconut Grove neighborhood. Impactful experiences in Richmond Heights and Coconut Grove nurtured her consciousness and propelled her decades-long commitment to art for and about people. Specializing in printmaking and mixed media constructions, Bowens-Saffo's art delves into social and political human relations, emphasizing the African American experience.\nBorn in Richmond Heights, Florida and currently living and working in Tallahassee, Bowens-Saffo received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Howard University and her MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. She is the recipient of awards from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nFrom the Heights contemplates the role played by art collectives, explores the importance of archiving an artist’s oeuvre, and enlightens issues of race, gender, and class as it relates to history writing.\nThis exhibition was developed in collaboration with the Women Artists Archive Miami (WAAM).\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor, and Board of County Commissioners. They are sponsored in part by the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture, the John S. and James L.

    "Event Summary": "From the Heights marks South Florida native Kabuya Pamela Bowens-Saffo’s first solo art exhibition in Miami. Featuring works from as early as 1977 to present day, this exhibition celebrates the artist’s practice as a printmaker and honors her legacy as an active member of the South Florida art community.\nWhile based in Miami, Florida, Bowens-Saffo was engaged with the Miami Black Arts Workshop (MBAW) and an influential educator at the Barnyard Community Center in the historical Coconut Grove neighborhood. Impactful experiences in Richmond Heights and Coconut Grove nurtured her consciousness and propelled her decades-long commitment to art for and about people. Specializing in printmaking and mixed media constructions, Bowens-Saffo's art delves into social and political human relations, emphasizing the African American experience.\nBorn in Richmond Heights, Florida and currently living and working in Tallahassee, Bowens-Saffo received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Howard University and her MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. She is the recipient of awards from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nFrom the Heights contemplates the role played by art collectives, explores the importance of archiving an artist’s oeuvre, and enlightens issues of race, gender, and class as it relates to history writing.\nThis exhibition was developed in collaboration with the Women Artists Archive Miami (WAAM).\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor, and Board of County Commissioners. They are sponsored in part by the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture, the John S. and James L.

    "Event Title": "Kabuya Pamela Bowens-Saffo: From the Heights",
    "Event Summary": "From the Heights marks South Florida native Kabuya Pamela Bowens-Saffo’s first solo art exhibition in Miami. Featuring works from as early as 1977 to present day, this exhibition celebrates the artist’s practice as a printmaker and honors her legacy as an active member of the South Florida art community.\nWhile based in Miami, Florida, Bowens-Saffo was engaged with the Miami Black Arts Workshop (MBAW) and an influential educator at the Barnyard Community Center in the historical Coconut Grove neighborhood. Impactful experiences in Richmond Heights and Coconut Grove nurtured her consciousness and propelled her decades-long commitment to art for and about people. Specializing in printmaking and mixed media constructions, Bowens-Saffo's art delves into social and political human relations, emphasizing the African American experience.\nBorn in Richmond Heights, Florida and currently living and working in Tallahassee, Bowens-Saffo received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Howard University and her MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. She is the recipient of awards from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nFrom the Heights contemplates the role played by art collectives, explores the importance of archiving an artist’s oeuvre, and enlightens issues of race, gender, and class as it relates to history writing.\nThis exhibition was developed in collaboration with the Women Artists Archive Miami (WAAM).\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor, and Board of County Commissioners. They are sponsored in part by the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture, the John S. and James L.

    "Event Summary": "From the Heights marks South Florida native Kabuya Pamela Bowens-Saffo’s first solo art exhibition in Miami. Featuring works from as early as 1977 to present day, this exhibition celebrates the artist’s practice as a printmaker and honors her legacy as an active member of the South Florida art community.\nWhile based in Miami, Florida, Bowens-Saffo was engaged with the Miami Black Arts Workshop (MBAW) and an influential educator at the Barnyard Community Center in the historical Coconut Grove neighborhood. Impactful experiences in Richmond Heights and Coconut Grove nurtured her consciousness and propelled her decades-long commitment to art for and about people. Specializing in printmaking and mixed media constructions, Bowens-Saffo's art delves into social and political human relations, emphasizing the African American experience.\nBorn in Richmond Heights, Florida and currently living and working in Tallahassee, Bowens-Saffo received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Howard University and her MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University. She is the recipient of awards from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nFrom the Heights contemplates the role played by art collectives, explores the importance of archiving an artist’s oeuvre, and enlightens issues of race, gender, and class as it relates to history writing.\nThis exhibition was developed in collaboration with the Women Artists Archive Miami (WAAM).\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor, and Board of County Commissioners.

NWSA Visual Arts will host a variety of local and national experts to talk about what happened once the research is completed, the experimentation in the studio is done, and the body of work is produced. The invited experts will cover topics like how to put together a successful portfolio, how to connect with local art institutions, how do artist build their networks, and what opportunities for graduate education exist in Miami.  This series of lecture-conversations are organized in the spirit of helping students to build their tribe and their art communities.\nSharon Louden wears many interchangeable hats including artist, educator, advocate for artists, consultant, community builder, and editor of the Living and Sustaining a Creative Life series of books. As an artist, her work has evolved from using writing as a medium, to figuration then abstraction through her paintings and drawings, to creating many physical environments that involve an inclusive advocacy using a varied range of media. In addition, Sharon is a visionary leader with decades of experience as an educator in academia, community connector & catalyst fighting for underrepresented artists within established institutions. She is a collaborator who convenes initiatives with siloed stakeholders across the non-profit and business sectors. All of her work is considered a creative practice under the umbrella of a working artist. Louden graduated with a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA from Yale University School of Art. Her work has been exhibited in numerous venues including the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, the Drawing Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Weisman Art Museum, National Gallery of Art, Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art.",

He received classical training as a painter at the St. Petersburg Fine Art Lyceé before relocating to the US. He graduated from the University of the Incarnate Word with a BA in Studio Art with a concentration in photography and a BA in Interior Environmental Design. Later, he received a Master of Architecture from the University of Texas in Austin. Driven by a deep sense of empathy and a commitment to social justice, Payusov sheds light on untold stories and marginalized communities, amplifying their voices through his lens. Whether documenting the plight of refugees in war-torn regions or celebrating the resilience of indigenous cultures, he approaches each subject with reverence and authenticity, seeking to foster understanding and compassion in an increasingly divided world. Nikita Payusov's work has been showcased in notable publications and exhibitions around the globe, earning him recognition in contemporary documentary photography and social reportage.",

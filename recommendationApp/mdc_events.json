      "Event Summary": "100 Faces of War (http://100facesofwarexperience.org/), a traveling exhibition from the Smithsonian, features 100 oil portraits of Americans who went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, by artist Matt Mitchell (Virtually). YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/8db2TMHbR-I\nTo understand something as complex as the American experience of war in Iraq and Afghanistan it is useful to listen to many perspectives.\nThe 100 Faces exhibition shows a cross-section of Americans who went to these wars between 2001 and 2014.  Each person met the artist and was asked to say something about themselves.  They could say whatever they wanted.  The statement they provided, and their bio represent that moment in their personal history.\nWho are the one percent of Americans that volunteer to defend the 99 percent? 100 Faces of War presents a new way to understand the stories of the soldiers and citizens who served our country during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through these portraits and their own words, we come to know their strengths and frailties, their courage and fears, their warmth and humanity. Their words were not edited, and some opinions and language may be considered strong. Each statement represents the feelings and emotions of the sitter alone. Some sat for portraits just days after returning home, and their words reflect their recent experience of conflict. This exhibition is a place of contemplation—unlike a history written by a single author, here you will find one hundred different and highly personal ways of looking at duty, sacrifice, and the human experience of war.",

      "Event Summary": "The third installment of MOAD Pavilions, a public art series located in downtown Miami, invites visitors to contemplate the paths we carve and traverse in our lives and the continuous flow of experiences that shape us. Designed by Miami-based artist GeoVanna Gonzalez, Flowing Pathways is an architectural intervention. The installation presents a series of interconnected geometric frames juxtaposed with rounded, organic shapes that reference rivers and waterways. This contrast highlights the harmony and tension between natural elements and human made environments.\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, California, GeoVanna Gonzalez received a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Otis College of Art and Design and is the recipient of several awards including the South Arts Southern Prize and State Fellowship, WaveMaker Grant, and the Ellie Visual Arts Award.\nMOAD's programs are made possible with the support of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Cultural Affairs Council, the Miami-Dade County Mayor and Board of County Commissioners. They are sponsored in part by the State of Florida through the Division of Arts and Culture and the National Endowment for the Arts, and with generous support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The Miami Herald is a media sponsor of MOAD's programming.\nImage courtesy of the artist.",
